# Project History & Context

## Project Name
Algorithm Visualizer Web App

## Project Goal
A web application to visually demonstrate and compare sorting algorithms. Users can input arrays, select algorithms and languages, visualize step-by-step execution, and control playback speed. The UI is designed for clarity, interactivity, and educational value.

## What Has Been Implemented
- **Core UI:**
  - Responsive layout using React and Material-UI (MUI)
  - Monaco Editor for code display and line highlighting
  - Visualizer for array/algorithm steps (side-by-side with editor)
  - Controls for running, pausing, resetting, randomizing, and switching modes
- **Algorithm Support:**
  - Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort
  - Languages: JavaScript, Python, C++
- **Features:**
  - Single and comparison mode (side-by-side algorithm comparison)
  - Dynamic code highlighting in the editor as the algorithm runs
  - Adjustable speed slider (up to 10x)
  - Randomize array (random size and values)
  - Reset and explain buttons
  - Proper enable/disable and press effects for all controls
  - Editor and graph are always the same size and aligned
- **Recent Fixes:**
  - Changing speed while running no longer pauses the visualization
  - Only one editor and one graph are shown in single mode, side by side
  - Layout and UX improvements for clarity and usability
  - Fixed the case-sensitivity issue for the comparison mode screenshot in the README by matching the filename (SS.jpg) with the reference in the README, ensuring the image displays correctly on GitHub.
  - Added a fully animated, theme-matching Merge Sort tree visualization using Framer Motion. The tree now animates the recursive splitting and merging process step-by-step, showing the entire process from breakdown to final sorted array. This is visually impressive and educational, and is integrated with the app's dark theme.
  - Refactored MergeSortTree to model the merge sort process as a sequence of tree states, enabling true step-by-step animation.
  - All changes have been pushed to GitHub.

## Libraries, Frameworks, and Languages
- **Frontend:**
  - React (TypeScript)
  - Material-UI (MUI)
  - Monaco Editor (`@monaco-editor/react`)
- **Styling:**
  - CSS (App.css, Visualizer.css, etc.)
- **Other:**
  - Custom code parsing and step generation utilities

## Notable Design/UX Decisions
- Editor and visualizer are always side by side in single mode
- Code line highlighting is synchronized with the current algorithm step
- All controls are accessible and visually distinct
- Comparison mode disables the editor and shows two visualizers
