# AlgoViz - Algorithm Visualizer

![AlgoViz Home](home.jpg)

## Overview

AlgoViz is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates and compares sorting algorithms. Users can input arrays, select algorithms and programming languages, visualize step-by-step execution, and control playback speed. The UI is designed for clarity, interactivity, and educational value.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort
- **Multiple Programming Languages**: View implementations in JavaScript, Python, and C++
- **Interactive Visualization**: Step-by-step execution with adjustable speed
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare two algorithms side-by-side
- **Code Highlighting**: Synchronized code highlighting as algorithms execute
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
